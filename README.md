Create Graphical representation of Software System 

The original idea was to to create dynamic diagrams that could represent any software system. The idea came about because I  used to work for a power company and they had fantistic diagramatic representations of their networks. These diagrams provided so much inforamtion in such a great way you could watch then for hours. I thought this would be a great idea for software (yep i did !) and i also wanted to learn a little bit about WPF, (5 years to late , but WTF!). I have used bits of code off the net especially sukram (Marcus) http://www.codeproject.com/script/Membership/View.aspx?mid=65924  an excellent article about creating WPF diagrams. However after starting I have not had much time to work on it even though it has become quite interesting, as it encompasses different technologies. So I am still working on it. There are so many other technologies that would make this much easiser and much much better. I will upload the code has soon as i can figure out how to use GIT. Taking VSS really does screw you up.
