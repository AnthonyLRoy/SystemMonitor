Create Graphical representation of Software System 

The original idea was to to create dynamic diagrams that would represent any software system. The idea came about because I  used to work for a power company and they allways had diagramatic representations of their networks. These diagram provided so much inforamtion inn such a great way you could watch then for hours. I thought this would be a great idea for Software (yep i did !) and i aslo wanted to learn a little bit about WPF, (5 years to late , but WTF!). I have used bits of code off of the net especially sukram (Marcus) http://www.codeproject.com/script/Membership/View.aspx?mid=65924  an excellent article about creating WPF diagrams. However after starting this project it has become quite interesting, as it encompasses different technologies. So I am still working on it there are so many other technologies that would make this much easiser and much much better. I will upload the code has soon as i can figure out how to use GIT. Taking VSS really does screw you up.
